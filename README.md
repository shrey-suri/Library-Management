# Library Management System

This project is a fully functional Library Management System implemented in Java, utilizing Java Swing and Applet libraries. The system is designed to facilitate efficient management of library operations with user-defined passwords for both the admin and librarians. 

## Features

The Library Management System offers the following features:

### Admin:

- **Add / View / Delete Librarian**: The admin has the privilege to add, view, and delete librarian accounts. This feature ensures efficient management of librarian accounts and their corresponding responsibilities.

### Librarian:

- **Add / View / Issue Books**: Librarians can add new books to the library database, view existing books, and issue books to library members. This feature enables librarians to manage the library's collection effectively.

- **View Issued Books**: Librarians can access a list of issued books, allowing them to monitor the books currently borrowed by library members. This feature facilitates book tracking and ensures smooth operation of the library.

- **Return Books**: Librarians can process the return of borrowed books. This feature updates the status of returned books and makes them available for other library members to borrow.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Library**: Java Swing
- **Database**: Microsoft Access

## Usage

To run the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Install Java on your system if it is not already installed.
2. Compile and run the Java source files.
3. Ensure that the required dependencies are available and properly configured.
4. Set up the Microsoft Access database according to the system's requirements.
5. Launch the application and explore its various features.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the Library Management System provides essential functionality, there are several areas that can be improved in future updates:

- **User Interface**: Enhance the user interface to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing experience for both administrators and librarians.

- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature that allows users to search for books based on different criteria such as title, author, genre, etc. This would make it easier for users to find specific books within the library's collection.

- **Reporting**: Develop a reporting module that generates statistical reports and insights about the library's operations, including book circulation, popular genres, and overdue books.

- **Integration with Online Catalog**: Integrate the system with an online catalog or library management platform to enable users to search for books, place holds, and renew books remotely.

- **Enhanced Security**: Strengthen the security of the system by implementing encryption for sensitive data, implementing role-based access control, and adding additional layers of authentication.
